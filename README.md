# Alpine docker with Kafka and Elasticsearch
Dockerfile for a simple alpine docker container setup with Kafka 0.11 and Elasticsearch 5.6. It also includes ssh access (if needed), so a ssh *config* and *id_rsa* are allowed too to be copied into the container.

Credits for Kafka integration to [danielguerra69](https://github.com/danielguerra69/alpine-kafka).
